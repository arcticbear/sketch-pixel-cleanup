# Pixel Cleanup For Sketch
### (AKA Death To The Half Pixel)

One of the best things about Sketch is having your designs be pixel perfect. However, there are a variety of things that can end up with pesky portion-of-a-pixel positioning.

This beta plugin will round all of your pixels to whole pixels.

It works well for the following:

1. Lines
1. Rectangles
1. Groups
1. Nested versions of these things

It may work with others, but I haven't tested it fully.

## WARNING
This is a beta. Use at your own risk.
You should do this anyway, but use version control before trying this out on an important document

All you have to do is select a layer or group and press the keyboard shortcut for this function is `⌥⌘P`

All feedback and issues are welcome!
Happy pixel hunting!
